I've been working in multiple projects, below are some examples.\newline\newline
\project{PELUX embeded platform}
        {Right now I am a member of the core team which developes a Linux based platform for automotive projects. We develop everything in the open and one can follow the developement via http://pelux.io. My work involves setting up and documenting the way of working with the platform which includes templates, best practices and devops as well as continuous integration and deployment.}
\project{Custom Linux platform}
        {For two years I've been working as a lead developer in the platform team in big customer project. I helped to set up their custom Linux distribution with Yocto, set up the devops operations and was training people on how to properly work with the whole system. I did that by developing and documenting processes they could follow and offering a SDK and ADK. Later I was developing middleware services for the platform.}

\employment{Odelay}
     {Head of developement}
     {2008 -- 2014}

\employment{Infogate}

I find learning languages easy and fun because I've learned many of the paradigms already, therefore I've been using many more languages over the years. I try to use the right tool for the problem even if that means learning a new language to do so.

\subsection*{Bachelor's Thesis}
The thesis\footnote{\url{https://jeena.net/t/GGS.pdf}} investigates whether it is possible to create a programming language agnostic application server specialized for game-like applications. A prototype of the game server was written in Erlang, capable of powering several hundred simple game instances written in JavaScript.

\section*{Personal notes}
  {I am born in Poland and moved to Germany when I was 11 years old. Later by the age of 27 I moved to Sweden.}
  {Overall I'm very interested in technology so even in my free time I end up programming and looking into new cool languages, projects\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jeena}}, etc. I am very passionate when it comes to free and open source software as well as privacy. That's why I'm a active member of the IndieWeb\footnote{\url{https://indieweb.org}} community.}
  {I also play in a small metal band\footnote{\url{http://hoggatah.se}}, am a amateur photographer\footnote{\url{https://flickr.com/jeena/albums/72157677196990660}}, a podcaster\footnote{\url{https://jeena.net/pods/}} and I brew beer at home.}

             {I have been involved in multiple projects, below are some examples.\newline}
             
\project{PELUX embedded platform}
        {Right now I am a member of the core team which developes a Linux based platform for automotive projects. My work involves setting up and documenting the way of working with the platform which includes templates, best practices and devops as well as continuous integration and deployment.\newline}
        
\project{Custom Linux platform}
        {For two years I worked as a lead developer in the platform team in a big customer project. I helped setting up their custom Linux distribution with Yocto, setting up the devops operations and was training people on how to properly work with the whole system. I did that by developing and documenting processes they could follow and offering an SDK and ADK. Later I developed middleware services for the platform.}

\employment{Odelay}
     {Head of developemnt}
     {2008 -- 2014}
     {Odelay was a startup in Stockholm where I was the first developer. I mostly wrote iPhone and big web applications and took care of the Linux web servers we used. As we grew I became head of developement.}

\employment{Infogate}
     {Web frontend developer}
     {2007 -- 2008}
     {At Infogate I was responsible for implementing websites for big customers like golf.se, Högskolan Väst, Berns Salonger and many more. My responsibility was also to rewrite the frontend code for their in-house CMS to get it valid, accessible and semantically meaningful.}

\employment{Other}
     {Heating engineer and factory worker}
     {1994 -- 2006}
     {Back in Germany I was not working in IT but at a factory and as a construction worker.}

I find learning languages easy and fun and since I have learned many programming paradigms already I have used even more languages than are listed above. I try to use the right tool for the problem, even if that means learning a new language to do so.

\subsection*{Bachelor's Thesis}
The thesis\footnote{\url{https://jeena.net/t/GGS.pdf}} investigates whether it is possible to create a programming language agnostic application server specialized for game-like applications. A prototype of the game server was written in Erlang, capable of powering several hundred simple game instances written in JavaScript.

\section*{Personal notes}
  {I was born in Poland but at the age of 11 my family moved to Germany where I spend my teens and early adulthood. Later by the age of 27 I moved to Sweden.}
  {Overall I'm very interested in technology so even in my free time I end up programming and looking into new cool languages, projects\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jeena}}, etc. I am very passionate when it comes to free and open source software as well as privacy. That's why I'm an active member of the IndieWeb\footnote{\url{https://indieweb.org}} community.}
  {I also play in a small metal band\footnote{\url{http://hoggatah.se}}, am an amateur photographer\footnote{\url{https://flickr.com/jeena/albums/72157677196990660}}, a podcaster\footnote{\url{https://jeena.net/pods/}} and I brew beer at home.}
